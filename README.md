Input files, code, and data for the paper
All our calculations were performed using VASP, specifically version vasp.5.4.4. Due to the large size of the software, we can only provide the download link: www.vasp.at.

The post-processing software vaspkit was utilized, which is an open-source tool available at: https://vaspkit.com/.

Phonon spectra and Berry curvature calculations were carried out with the phonopy and vaspberry software, respectively.

The three crystal structures and corresponding input files discussed in this paper are provided.
